Some functions to use in processing geomagnetic field data
In this repository there are functions that are useful in dealing with geomagnetic data and models. Many of these were first collected together as the basis of practical sessions for students at the IAGA Summer School held in Canada in 2019. The complete package for that event, including the Jupyter notebooks used to illustrate various aspacts of geomagnetism can be found at <Insert reference>. Here there will be many of the same functions, but some will have been updated or tweaked, so this should be seen as a development site.
