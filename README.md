Some functions to use in processing geomagnetic field data

In this repository there are Python functions that are useful in dealing with geomagnetic data and models (such as the International Geomagnetic Reference Field). Many of these functions were first collected together as the basis of practical sessions for students at the IAGA Summer School held in Canada in 2019. The complete package for that event, including the Jupyter notebooks used to illustrate various aspacts of geomagnetism can be found at  https://github.com/MagneticEarth/IAGA_SummerSchool2019. Here there will be many of the same functions, but some will have been updated or tweaked, so this should be seen as a development site.
